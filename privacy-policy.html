                            Data protection is of a particularly high priority for codeindevelopers.com.ng. Personal
                            data
                            processing, including your
                            name, address, email, or phone number, will always be in line with the General Data
                            Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
                            other data protection regulations applicable to codeindevelopers.com.ng.

                            Using our website, you automatically agree to the following terms. If you do not agree with
                            any of this document's
                            statements, please contact us before using our website, or any of its pages, folders, and
                            subdomains. We have the right
                            to change our privacy policy without prior notice. Therefore, we advise all users to
                            regularly check this page and stay
                            aware of its latest version.

                            1. General Information
                            Via this data protection statement, we inform the general public of the nature, scope, and
                            purpose of the personal data
                            we collect, use, and process. Furthermore, this data protection declaration contains
                            information on the website users'
                            rights.

                            As the data controller and processor, codeindevelopers.com.ng has implemented numerous
                            technical and organizational measures
                            to ensure your data's complete protection throughout the website codeindevelopers.com.ng and
                            all its subdomains. Since
                            Internet-based data transmissions may have security gaps, more than absolute protection is
                            needed. Moreover, every data
                            subject is free to transfer personal data to us via direct and indirect means, e.g., email
                            or phone support.

                            2. Information Types We Collect
                            We collect certain information about visitors and users of our websites. The type and scope
                            of information differ
                            according to the referral source and user status.

                            2.1. Information We Obtain from Authors
                            We can collect the author's name, company name, IP address, email address, phone number(s),
                            photo ID, social media
                            account URLs, payment details (billing information), and survey responses initiated for
                            research purposes.

                            We use this information to provide authors with support or improve our services. E.g., this
                            data is necessary to pay
                            commissions, verify authors' identities, deliver advertising and marketing services,
                            contact, support, and invoice them.

                            2.2. Information We Obtain from Buyers
                            We collect a buyer’s name, username, email address, phone number(s), physical location, and
                            contact details. Moreover,
                            we can collect, store, and use information about a buyer’s devices used to visit and
                            interact with our websites. It
                            includes information about the browser, referring source, and buyer's IP address. We can
                            also have limited access to
                            third-party billing details collected by buyer's payment systems (billing country,
                            cardholder name, PayPal email
                            address), transaction details, support queries, web analytics data, and data buyers provide

                            websites.

                            changes in policy
                            notifications, and administrative messages. We can also use this data for statistical,
                            analytical, and management
                            purposes and prevent fraud, and breach of policies/terms, including threats and harm.

                            2.3. Information We Obtain from Partners
                            We collect partner names, company names, website URLs, phone numbers, billing addresses,

                            IDs, and payment information. We use this information to work with partners, confirm their
                            identity, contact, pay,
                            support, and screen for risk, fraud, or other similar issues. Moreover, we use this data to

                            We collect the visitors` device type and browser, network connection, IP address, cookies,
                            and other web analytics data.
                            We may also collect personal information submitted by visitors via any forms available on
                            our websites, i.e., chat,
                            ticket system, subscription, and contact forms.

                            2.5. Information We Obtain from Users via Chat, Phone Calls, and other Indirect Means
                            We collect names, emails, information about the device and browser they use, chat
                            transcript, and other personal
                            information they provide during the chat or call. According to our Support Policy and Terms
                            of Use, we may request
                            additional details from the users during our conversation to verify their identity or for
                            technical support purposes.

                            3. Means of Personal Data Collection
                            We collect personal information when visitors perform certain actions on our websites. Those
                            actions include but are not
                            limited to registration, purchasing/ordering items or services on our sites, subscribing to
                            our newsletter, submitting
                            feedback, entering a contest, filling out a survey, or sending us a communication request
                            via any available means.
                            We automatically collect personal information while users navigate through our sites or 3rd
                            party sources that refer to
                            our websites.
                            We can ask users to provide login details to their website admin panel or hosting account
                            (server) if they order
                            additional offers from our Service Center or partners. The services are template
                            installation, website customization,
                            image replacement, WordPress plugin installation, etc. Users may refuse to share the login
                            details of their website or
                            hosting account. In this case, we can refuse to provide the service.
                            4. Receiving Information from Third Parties
                            In addition to the data we get from the visitors, we may collect, store, and analyze users`
                            personal information from
                            other sources.

                            We receive financial and transaction details from payment providers to process the
                            transactions and complete digital
                            product purchases.
                            Third-party services like Google, Facebook, and Twitter may provide us with certain
                            information about our visitors when
                            they link/connect/log in to our website using their social media login or associated email.
                            The amount of information
                            may vary and can be controlled and changed by a third-party service provider or user via
                            privacy settings.
                            We can obtain demographic data and fraud detection information from third-party sources and
                            combine them with the info
                            we have about the visitors to confirm their identity. These can be identity verification
                            services used for fraud warning
                            purposes.
                            5. Personal Details Use Cases
                            5.1. Order Processing
                            We require users' personal information mainly when we need to define their identity for

                            website and all its subdomains, e.g., when they purchase items and services from our

                            We can use users' personal information when they give us consent:

                            to provide them with marketing information relating to products and services which may be of
                            interest to them;
                            to modify/customize our offers and website layout using cookies, e.g., advertising that
                            appears on our website can be
                            adapted to provide users with a personalized experience.
                            Users can change their decision and ask us to delete their personal information at any time
                            by sending a request to
                            privacy@codeindevelopers.com.ng.

                            5.4. Legal Requests
                            If necessary, we can handle personal user information for purposes required by the law.
                            E.g., for granting court of law,
                            law enforcement authorities, government requests, or any other occasions that may relate to
                            judicial investigations.

                            6. Personal Information Disclosure
                            Personal information of our users may be accessed by:

                            company employees who need it to perform their tasks and duties;
                            third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it.
                            We may share a user's personal information with third parties in the following cases.

                            The customer consents to the disclosure.
                            We need to disclose partial data for support purposes and third-party software
                            validation/activation.
                            The customer orders a third-party service on our website, and subcontractors or service
                            providers need the data to
                            perform the offer. Subcontractors or service providers may access your personal information
                            from their operational
                            countries.
                            It is required to protect our rights or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or
                            legal process.
                            7. Personal Information Storage and Protection
                            CodeinDevelopers has its major facility located in the USA. In addition, the company
                            cooperates with outsourcing
                            employees worldwide to provide users with in-time support and a high level of services. We
                            can store your personal data
                            on different local servers. To protect your information, we also work with subcontractors
                            who can maintain standards of
                            data security compliance.

                            7.1. Storage Time
                            Users` information is stored on our servers as long as it is needed to provide them with our
                            services and comply with
                            legal obligations.

                            If users don’t want us to store their personal information, they have the right to get it
                            deleted, but in this case,
                            we’ll have to deactivate their CodeinDevelopers accounts.

                            All information about deleted accounts stays on our servers to use for our legitimate
                            business interests: comply with
                            the law, prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations,
                            enforce the service terms,
                            or take other actions permitted by law. We handle the information we retain following this
                            Privacy Policy.

                            7.2. Security Measures
                            To keep user information secure, we apply specific measures to protect it against
                            unauthorized or illegal use,
                            accidental loss, or destruction.

                            We share and provide user information access to the minimum necessary extent, subject to
                            confidentiality restrictions
                            where appropriate, and on an anonymized basis wherever possible.
                            To store user information, we use secure servers.
                            We verify the identity of all individuals who request access to private information before
                            granting them access.
                            We use SSL certificate encryption to protect the data transfer.
                            We are not responsible if users try to circumvent privacy settings on our websites. If we
                            provide users with access to
                            certain parts of our website, they are responsible for keeping them safe. Users must not
                            share access details with third
                            parties.

                            Due to obvious reasons, we cannot control all users' actions on our websites, e.g., in
                            public comments, forums, etc.
                            Therefore, we recommend customers share their information in public areas wisely, as we
                            cannot guarantee that
                            unauthorized parties will not view the data, which users publish on the web.

                            When users choose to share their information via a third-party website, they need to check
                            that website's privacy policy
                            to be aware of its information management and protection practices.

                            8. Privacy Management
                            All personal information that we collect about users is available in their accounts. Users
                            have the right to make all
                            the necessary edits and changes to this data.

                            Users can receive personal information in a structured, machine-readable format, edit,
                            erase, or restrict its
                            processing. They can also object to their data processing for a set of company interests,
                            such as profiling for direct
                            marketing and other cases when we need their consent to data processing.

                            There are several situations when these rights can be limited, and we can retain user
                            information after they withdraw
                            their consent. Those are cases where we may require personal data to be compliant with legal
                            or contractual obligations.
                            If users do not provide us with such data, we can not complete the service. In all other
                            cases providing requested
                            information can be optional.

                            If users have unresolved concerns, they have the right to complain to the data protection
                            authorities. If you believe
                            that our company violates your privacy rights, please contact us at
                            privacy@codeindevelopers.com.ng

                            9. Marketing Use of Your Personal Information
                            If we have users' consent, we can send them marketing materials with information about
                            products, services, or discounts.
                            If they decide not to receive such email notifications, they can easily opt out using the
                            unsubscribe option or contact
                            us at unsubscribe@codeindevelopers.com.ng.

                            9.1. Web Beacons
                            We use web beacons. It is a means to track the website's use on occasions, like promotions
                            or newsletters. The data we
                            collect via web beacons allow us to track the number of users who opened our newsletters.
                            Also, web beacons help us to
                            understand user behavior and improve UX.

                            9.2. Google Analytics
                            CodeinDevelopers uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service created by Google, Inc.
                            Google Analytics software uses
                            cookies to analyze user behavior. All data (i.e., user activity on the
                            codeindevelopers.com.ng
                            domain and all its
                            subdomains) is gathered by cookies and stored on Google cloud data centers, most of which
                            are in the U.S.

                            In turn, Google uses this data to evaluate user behavior in general, compile reports for
                            site managers, and provide data
                            to services related to website activity and Internet usage. Google may transfer various data
                            to third parties when
                            required to do so by law or when such third parties process the information on Google's
                            behalf.

                            In no way will Google associate user IP addresses with any other data held by Google. If
                            users do not want to provide
                            Google with the browsing data, they can block cookies via browser settings. Users can find
                            more information on Google
                            opt-out, Privacy, and Google Analytics.

                            10. Cookie Files

                            use cookies to provide users
                            with access to all website features as well as to analyze, personalize, and improve user

                            11.1 Testimonials
                            In addition to various endorsements, we display testimonials on our website. We publish
                            testimonials only after
                            receiving users' consent to specify their names. If users want to delete or modify their

                            11.3. Social media platforms and widgets
                            All CodeinDevelopers websites have embedded social media features, e.g., Facebook `Like`
                            button. These features may
                            collect users' data like IP address or place a cookie in their browser to gather statistical
                            information about their
                            interactions with our websites. Social media features are hosted both on our website and on
                            servers of a specific social
                            media network.

                            Apart from these features, we maintain profiles on major networks, including Facebook,
                            Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram,
                            LinkedIn, etc. Any information users submit on these networks in public areas, like
                            comments, can be easily read,
                            collected, or stored by all users of these networks. We cannot control the actions of other
                            social media users or the
                            actions of these platforms. According to their privacy policies, only the related social
                            media platforms manage user
                            activity and interaction with those features.

                            11.4. Links to other websites
                            If users click on a link to a third-party site, they leave our site. Since we cannot control
                            third parties' activities,
                            we do not bear responsibility for any use of your personal information by those parties.
                            Users should review the privacy
                            policy of any other website they visit.

                            12. Data Erasure
                            The information controller shall process and store the data subject's data only for the time
                            necessary to achieve the
                            purpose of storage according to the U.S. legislator or other legislators in laws or
                            regulations to which the controller
                            is subject.

                            If the storage purpose isn't applicable or a storage time prescribed by the U.S. legislator
                            or another competent
                            legislator expires, the personal data is blocked or erased.

                            CodeinDevelopers retains the right to block users` accounts and erase the related data if
                            they didn't log in and take any
                            action for 6 (six) months or more. It relates to customer, author, and affiliate accounts.

                            Users can create requests to delete their accounts and erase their personal information by
                            sending an email to
                            privacy@codeindevelopers.com.ng. The request processing can take up to 2 weeks until the
                            data
                            is deleted. Considering that
                            we use several third-party services, including email newsletter tools, and external ads
                            services. An immediate client's
                            rejection to receive notifications/ads may be impossible due to 3rd party services,
                            browsers` cache, and other technical
                            reasons.

                            13. Children's Online Privacy
                            Children under 13 years old should not use CodeinDevelopers websites, products, and
                            services. No one under the age of 13
                            (thirteen) years old can provide personal information to or on our websites. We are not
                            collecting information from
                            children under 13 years old. Users under 13 years old cannot use any of our websites, buy
                            products from the marketplace,
                            comment on blog posts, or social media posts, or provide personal information about
                            themselves, including their name,
                            address, phone number, and email. If we learn that users violated this term, we will
                            immediately delete their accounts
                            and all information. If you believe that we may have some information provided by your
                            child, please contact us at
                            privacy@codeindevelopers.com.ng.

                            14. Changes in Our Privacy Policy
                            As the data controller and data processor, we reserve the right to change or modify this
                            Privacy Policy at any time. We
                            publish the changes on this Privacy Policy page and notify users via email if necessary.

                            Depending on the context of personal information users provide, CodeinDevelopers can be a
                            data controller and processor.
                            CodeinDevelopers is a processor of personal information submitted to the services or
                            collected through the related
                            services.

                            If users have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, including their information
                            collection, storage, and
                            processing, or if they believe that we violate their privacy rights, they can contact us at
                            privacy@codeindevelopers.com.ng.
                            We respond to all requests, inquiries, or concerns within fifteen (15) days.

                            Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for user convenience only. To avoid
                            ambiguous interpretations and
                            translation inaccuracies, users should use the English version as the source.
